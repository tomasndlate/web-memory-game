## Overview

This project is a web-based game with a structured HTML, JavaScript, and CSS implementation. The latest version includes several structural improvements and additional features to enhance the user experience:

Options to adjust username, email, password, game volume, and mobile mode preference. The layout has been designed for good usability.

Navigation: The top-right button has been moved to the footer and renamed from "Extras" to "Contents." This section contains a collection of all decks and Berry’s available in the game.

Easter Egg: Hidden in the top part of the map, behind the time counter—explore and enjoy!
